# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked and Cloned 100 Days of Code to my local repo; Created a new index.html; Started w/ Basic HTML/HTML5 in freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** I haven't stayed up this late and still feel focused and engergized to code and learn more about coding. I think this is the motivation I have been looking for.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: May 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I'm relearning how to work on .md files; 

**Thoughts** I googled for two actions I didn't know how to move forward in github and in an md file. I feel good that I dont feel stuck on a subject. I was able to push forward on my coding journey.
